# Execute a Queue Item

Perform the external action for ONE drafted queue item and move it to its terminal
state. This is the single source of truth for "what approving an item actually does" —
both the interactive review queue and the remote ntfy approval path call into it.

## Inputs

- **item** — the path to a queue file (or a bare filename resolved against
  `~/.claude/engineer-agent/queue/drafts/`).
- **decision** — `approve` or `reject`.
- **reason** (optional) — rejection reason text; only used when `decision` is `reject`.

## Tools Needed

`Bash`, `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Glob`, `Grep`. Posting happens via the
[Spy](https://github.com/tomharris/spy) Slack CLI (`spy send …` over `Bash`), the `gh` CLI,
and the Slite MCP tools `mcp__slite__append-blocks`, `mcp__slite__create-note`.

## Steps

### 1. Load Config and Resolve the Item

Read `~/.claude/engineer-agent/engineer.yaml`. If missing, stop and report that
`/engineer-agent setup` must be run.

Extract:
- `agent.branch_prefix` — **required, no default.** Read the literal string verbatim. If
  missing/empty, stop and report that `agent.branch_prefix` must be set. Use this exact
  value wherever `{branch_prefix}` appears below.
- `agent.autonomy.auto_execute` — an optional list of action tiers that skip the approval
  gate (e.g. `["draft-pr"]`). Absent ⇒ empty list.

Resolve **item** to a file. If only a filename was given, look in
`~/.claude/engineer-agent/queue/drafts/`. **Idempotency:** if the file is not in
`drafts/` (already moved to `completed/` or `rejected/`, or never existed), do nothing and
report `already-handled` — this makes repeated/duplicate triggers safe.

Read the file's frontmatter (`type`, `source`, `source_url`, `project`, `ticket_key`,
etc.) and its `## Draft Response` section.

### 2. Reject Path

If **decision** is `reject`:
1. Add `rejected_reason: "{reason or 'rejected via execute'}"` to the frontmatter.
2. Set `status: rejected`.
3. Move the file to `~/.claude/engineer-agent/queue/rejected/`.
4. Report: `rejected {filename}`.

Stop here.

### 3. Approve Path — Guard Interactive-Only Types

If **decision** is `approve` and `type` is `qa-test-plan`, **do not execute headlessly.**
The QA flow is a three-phase interactive process (run tests, manual checklist, archive)
that requires a human at the terminal. Report:
`qa-test-plan must be completed interactively via /engineer-agent review-queue qa` and
leave the file untouched in `drafts/`.

### 4. Approve Path — Execute by Type

Look up the item's project config at `projects.<project>`. Determine the tracker type:
read `projects.<project>.tracker`, or infer from `source` frontmatter (`github` →
`github-issues`, `jira` → `jira`). Then dispatch on `type`:

- **pr-review** — submit the review via Bash. Use `--approve`, `--comment`, or
  `--request-changes` per the draft's **Recommendation** field:
  ```bash
  gh pr review {pr_number} --repo {repo} --{approve|comment|request-changes} --body "{review_body}"
  ```

- **slack-question** — post the reply in the original thread via the Spy CLI. Resolve the
  binary (`agent.slack.bin`, default `spy`) and workspace
  (`projects.<project>.slack.workspace` ?? `agent.slack.workspace`), then use the item's
  `channel_id` and `message_ts` (the thread parent):
  ```bash
  spy send {channel_id} "{reply_text}" --thread {message_ts} -w {workspace} --json
  ```

- **ticket** — create a **draft** PR. (See "Auto-execute: draft-pr" below for when this is
  allowed to run without a human approval.) Look up `projects.<project>.github.owner` and repo.
  - tracker `github-issues` (extract issue number from `ticket_key` stripping `#`; slug =
    title lowercased, non-alphanumeric → hyphens, truncated to 40 chars, trailing hyphens
    stripped):
    ```bash
    gh pr create --repo {owner}/{repo} --title "#{number}: {title}" \
      --body "{body with 'Closes #{number}'}" \
      --head "{branch_prefix}/issue-{number}-{slug}" --base main --draft
    ```
  - tracker `jira`:
    ```bash
    gh pr create --repo {owner}/{repo} --title "{ticket_key}: {title}" --body "{body}" \
      --head "{branch_prefix}/{ticket_key}" --base main --draft
    ```

- **doc-review** — call `mcp__slite__append-blocks` to post review comments on the document.

- **spec-refinement** — no external action. Report: `spec refinement complete; run
  /engineer-agent create-design-doc {source_url}`.

- **design-doc** — call `mcp__slite__create-note` with the title from frontmatter, parent
  from `projects.<project>.slite.design_doc_parent`, and content from `## Draft Response`.

- **ticket-refinement** — no external action. Report: `ticket refinement complete for
  {ticket_key}`.

- **ticket-plan** — by tracker:
  - `github-issues`: create an issue per ticket in the plan via
    `gh issue create --repo {owner}/{repo} --title "{title}" --body "{body}" --label "{labels}"`;
    report created issue URLs.
  - `jira` / `none`: no automated creation; report that the plan is approved for reference.

- **gap-audit** — no external action. Count gaps in the `### Checklist` section and report
  `gap audit acknowledged ({N} gaps)`.

- **code-audit-finding** — create a tracker ticket in the project's configured tracker.
  Pull the **Title** and **Body** from the `### Proposed ticket` subsection of `## Draft
  Response` (the `audit-code` skill formats it specifically for this step). Label the new
  ticket with `audit` and `audit:{audit_category}` (e.g. `audit:security`) when the tracker
  supports labels.
  - tracker `github-issues`:
    ```bash
    gh issue create --repo {owner}/{repo} --title "{title}" --body "{body}" \
      --label "audit" --label "audit:{audit_category}"
    ```
    Report the created issue URL.
  - tracker `jira`: create via `mcp__atlassian__createJiraIssue` in
    `projects.<project>.jira.sources[0].project` (or legacy `jira.project`), issue type
    `Bug` for `audit_category` in `security|correctness|dependency` and `Task` for
    `secret`. Set summary to `{title}`, description to `{body}`, and labels to `["audit",
    "audit-{audit_category}"]`. Report the created issue key/URL.
  - tracker `none`: do not move the file; report `no tracker configured for project
    {project}; leaving in drafts/` and exit non-zero so the user can fix config and retry.

- **codify-candidate** — perform a **local file write only** (no external post). Read
  `codify_target` and `codify_path` from frontmatter and the proposed content from the
  `### Proposed change to …` subsection of `## Draft Response`:
  - `memory-file`: `Write` the full file content to `codify_path`, then append the one-line
    pointer to the sibling `MEMORY.md` (create it if absent). If a memory file with the same
    `name` already exists, update it in place rather than duplicating.
  - `skill-note`: `Edit` the target `SKILL.md` at `codify_path` to append the proposed text to
    the indicated section.
  - `claude-md`: `Edit` the target `CLAUDE.md` at `codify_path` to add the proposed content.
  Confirm `codify_path` is within an expected location (a project `path`, a `skills/` dir, or a
  Claude Code `memory/` dir) before writing; if it looks wrong, leave the item in `drafts/`,
  report the mismatch, and exit non-zero. Report the file written on success.

- **qa-test-plan** — guarded in Step 3; never reached here.

### 5. Finalize

After a successful approve action, close the integrate loop before moving the file:

- **Findings & Disposition ledger.** For item types that surface findings (`pr-review`,
  `ticket`, `qa-test-plan`, `code-audit-finding`), the `## Draft Response` should carry a
  `### Findings & Disposition` ledger. If any finding still has a blank `Disposition`, fill it
  from what the approve action actually did (`fixed` / `accepted-risk` / `deferred` /
  `real-bug-filed` / `not-executed` / `n/a`) so the completed file is a self-contained
  "found X → did Y" record. Types with no findings (slack-question, design-doc, etc.) skip
  this.

Then set frontmatter `status: completed` and move the file to
`~/.claude/engineer-agent/queue/completed/`. Report a one-line result naming the action
taken (e.g. `approved pr-review org/repo#142 (commented)` or `created draft PR {url}`).

If the external action fails (e.g. `gh` non-zero, MCP error): **do not move the file.** Leave
it in `drafts/`, report the error, and exit non-zero so the caller can surface the failure
(and the item remains available to retry).

## Auto-execute: draft-pr

The `ticket` action above creates a **draft** PR. A draft PR merges nothing and requests no
review, so it is the one action safe to take without a human approval gate. Behavior:

- When this skill is invoked for an explicit human approval (interactive queue or remote
  approve), execute normally.
- When an automated caller (e.g. `implement-ticket` after Ralph Loop) wants to skip the
  gate, it should only do so when `draft-pr` is present in `agent.autonomy.auto_execute`.
  This skill itself always performs the action it is asked to; the *gating decision* lives
  with the caller, and `auto_execute` is the shared signal both honor.

All other actions (Slack posts, PR `approve`/`request-changes`, issue creation, non-draft
PRs) always require an explicit approve decision and are never auto-executed.
